virtual (idea recording) assistant 10/4/2021

This will eventually grow to include multiple pieces of functionality. I will be designing this virtual assistant for my own personal use. As such, it will reflect utility in many habits I prefer desirable, and will reflect my software development acumen accordingly.

Initially, I hope for this project to encapsulate a few basic functionalities:
  - Language Processing (for natural interaction)
  - Learning Interface - The interface will adapt given various factors. Clumsily at first, and then more rapidly as the user repeatedly interacts w/ the profile. 
  - Data storage, management, and retrieval
  - Basic Windows setting interactions
  - Basic external application interactions (databases, settings, ....?)
 
 There's always more room for growth.
 Eventually, I hope to be able to speak to my assistant, and hope to grant my assistant a personality of their own.

This readme will eventually condense into a changelog, and ultimately into a handy guide.
 
This week has seen several structural elements implemented into the code. Input verification functions are rough, but I have attempted to modularize them for more eventual incorporation into the entire program structure. 

So far, the program structure is pretty straightforward. Wake up, Get an idea, and decide to keep going from there. What I'm hoping to accomplish is a flexible, modularized code structure that evolves as the program is used. Meaning, this will be a learning program. The parametrization will be difficult, but not impossible. I have a lot to learn about machine learning and data modeling, but am confident it will be readily applicable. 0
