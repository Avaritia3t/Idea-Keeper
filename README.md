virtual (idea recording) assistant 10/4/2021

This will eventually grow to include multiple pieces of functionality. I will be designing this virtual assistant for my own personal use. As such, it will reflect utility in many habits I prefer desirable, and will reflect my software development acumen accordingly.

Initially, I hope for this project to encapsulate a few basic functionalities:
  - Language Processing (for natural interaction)
  - Learning Interface - The interface will adapt given various factors. Clumsily at first, and then more rapidly as the user repeatedly interacts w/ the profile. 
  - Data storage, management, and retrieval
  - Basic Windows setting interactions
  - Basic external application interactions (databases, settings, ....?)
 
 There's always more room for growth.
 Eventually, I hope to be able to speak to my assistant, and hope to grant my assistant a personality of their own.
